Someday I got a trouble with **decreased FPS** on external screen.
It affected on mouse smooth moving. Lags on application responses.
The problem was my Mac automatically changed external screen FPS.
So, to fix it had to **changed FPS back** to 60 from set 30.
To changed that is quite unclear. You need to do the following steps.

Step 1: Go to "System Preferences", and then go To "Displays"

Step 2: Hold "Alt" and Click on "Scaled"

Step 3: Choose 60 FPS option

After that your mouth should much much faster and lag should go await.
Hope it helped you! ðŸ˜¸
